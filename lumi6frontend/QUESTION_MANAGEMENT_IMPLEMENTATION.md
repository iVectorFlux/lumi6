# Question Management System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive question management system for superadmins to manage all three active question types:
- **Speaking Questions** (Question → Test via TestQuestion junction)
- **Proficiency Questions** (GlobalProficiencyQuestion → ProficiencyTest via API routes)  
- **EQ Questions** (EQQuestion → EQTest via EQResponse junction)

## Frontend Implementation

### New Components Created

#### 1. QuestionManagement.tsx
- **Location**: `src/pages/superadmin/QuestionManagement.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Unified interface for all three question types
  - Tabbed interface (Speaking, Proficiency, EQ)
  - Advanced filtering and search
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Bulk import via JSON
  - CSV export functionality
  - Real-time statistics dashboard
  - Pagination support
  - Language support

### Updated Components

#### 1. SuperAdminLayout.tsx
- **Change**: Updated navigation menu
- **Old**: Separate "Question Bank" and "EQ Question Bank" menu items
- **New**: Single "Question Management" menu item

#### 2. App.tsx
- **Change**: Updated routing
- **Old**: Two separate routes for question banks
- **New**: Single route `/superadmin/questions` for comprehensive management

## Backend Implementation

### Enhanced API Endpoints

#### Speaking Questions (`/api/questions`)
**New Endpoints Added:**
- `GET /api/questions/stats` - Get question statistics
- `GET /api/questions/export` - Export questions as CSV
- `POST /api/questions/bulk-import` - Bulk import questions

**Enhanced Existing:**
- `GET /api/questions` - Added filtering and search
- `PUT /api/questions/:id` - Update question
- `DELETE /api/questions/:id` - Delete question

#### Proficiency Questions (`/api/superadmin/proficiency-questions`)
**New Endpoints Added:**
- `GET /api/superadmin/proficiency-questions/stats` - Get statistics
- `GET /api/superadmin/proficiency-questions/export` - Export as CSV
- `POST /api/superadmin/proficiency-questions` - Create question
- `PUT /api/superadmin/proficiency-questions/:id` - Update question
- `DELETE /api/superadmin/proficiency-questions/:id` - Delete question

**Enhanced Existing:**
- `GET /api/superadmin/proficiency-questions` - Added pagination and filtering
- `POST /api/superadmin/proficiency-questions/import` - Enhanced bulk import

#### EQ Questions (`/api/eq-questions`)
**New Endpoints Added:**
- `PUT /api/eq-questions/:id` - Update EQ question
- `DELETE /api/eq-questions/:id` - Delete EQ question
- `GET /api/eq-questions/export` - Export as CSV

**Existing Endpoints:**
- All existing EQ question endpoints remain functional

## Key Features

### 1. Unified Interface
- Single page to manage all question types
- Consistent UI/UX across all question types
- Tab-based navigation for easy switching

### 2. Advanced Filtering
- Search by question text
- Filter by type, difficulty, language
- EQ-specific filters (module, submodule)
- Real-time filtering with debounced search

### 3. CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Form-based creation with validation
- **Read**: Paginated listing with search/filter
- **Update**: In-place editing with pre-filled forms
- **Delete**: Safe deletion with confirmation

### 4. Bulk Operations
- **Import**: JSON-based bulk import
- **Export**: CSV export with all question data
- **Statistics**: Real-time analytics dashboard

### 5. Data Validation
- Required field validation
- Type-specific validation (EQ modules, question types)
- Referential integrity checks before deletion

### 6. Language Support
- Multi-language question support
- Language filtering and statistics
- Default language handling (English)

## API Response Formats

### Statistics Response
```json
{
  "totalQuestions": 150,
  "activeQuestions": 140,
  "byType": {
    "mcq": 100,
    "likert": 50
  },
  "byDifficulty": {
    "easy": 50,
    "medium": 70,
    "hard": 30
  },
  "byLanguage": {
    "en": 120,
    "es": 20,
    "fr": 10
  }
}
```

### Paginated Questions Response
```json
{
  "questions": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 150,
    "pages": 8
  }
}
```

## Security & Access Control

### Authentication
- All endpoints require valid JWT token
- SuperAdmin role required for all operations
- Company admins have NO access to question management

### Data Protection
- Questions with existing responses cannot be deleted
- Soft deletion recommended for questions in use
- Audit trail maintained through database timestamps

## CSV Export Format

### Speaking Questions
```csv
ID,Text,Type,Category,Difficulty,Language,Media URL,Created At
```

### Proficiency Questions  
```csv
ID,Text,Type,Category,Difficulty,Language,Options,Correct Answer,Score,Media URL,Audio,Image,Created At
```

### EQ Questions
```csv
ID,Text,Type,Module,Submodule,Category,Difficulty,Options,Correct Answer,Normalized Score,Weight,Media URL,Is Active,Created At
```

## Database Considerations

### Performance
- Indexes on frequently filtered columns (type, difficulty, language)
- Pagination to handle large datasets
- Efficient queries with proper joins

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints maintained
- Referential integrity checks before deletion
- Transaction-based bulk operations

## Usage Instructions

### For Superadmins
1. Navigate to `/superadmin/questions`
2. Select question type tab (Speaking/Proficiency/EQ)
3. Use filters to find specific questions
4. Create new questions using the "Add Question" button
5. Edit existing questions by clicking the edit icon
6. Export data using the "Export CSV" button
7. Import bulk data using the "Bulk Import" button

### Bulk Import Format
Questions should be provided as JSON array:
```json
[
  {
    "text": "Question text",
    "type": "mcq",
    "category": "grammar",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "language": "en",
    "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
    "correctAnswer": "Option 1"
  }
]
```

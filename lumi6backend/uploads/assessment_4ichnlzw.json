    "feedback": "Your sentence structures and vocabulary are quite basic, which is why you have been categorized at the A2 level. Your repetitive statement about 'seeing a couple walking a dog' significantly impeded the coherence of your speech and demonstrated a lack of fluency. While your pronunciation is good, it is important to convey diversified thoughts and ideas rather than recycling the same phrases. It is advisable to practice using a wider range of vocabulary and sentence structures. Include more details and variety in your responses to demonstrate a better understanding and usage of English."

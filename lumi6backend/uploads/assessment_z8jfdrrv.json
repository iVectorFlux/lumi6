    "feedback": "Raya displays a good grasp of the English language, with well-articulated sentences and good vocabulary usage. Predominant areas of her strength lie in vocabulary and pronunciation. However, she has a tendency to use repeated phrases, possibly indicating a slight limitation in her vocabulary range. Moreover, her discourse could benefit from improved organization and reiterate clarity, as she tends to include somewhat irrelevant details or tangents. There is minor grammatical inaccuracies throughout her passage, which while subtle, one cannot ignore, especially concerning prepositions and articles. The fluency of the monologue could be improved through better cognitive linking of thoughts, focusing less on the ands and more on consistent discourse markers. Nonetheless, she seems confident in expressing complex emotions and thoughts, which is a positive attribute."

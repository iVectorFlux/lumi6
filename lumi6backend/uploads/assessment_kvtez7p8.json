    "feedback": "The candidate's overall performance suggests B1 level proficiency in English. The speech is fluent enough, although some constructions and agreements could be improved, especially in the sentence 'And I love with the experience and family getting, I love it.' The vocabulary use is average - no complex words or phrases are used but the basic vocabulary is displayed adequately. Pronunciation is clear and there are no issues with comprehensibility. However, coherence needs improvement as there are unclear phrases such as 'I don't have any situation and I never faced that Uttarakhand of situation.' which can cause confusion. Suitable language training focusing on overall sentence construction, clarity of thought, and more complex vocabulary should help increase proficiency."

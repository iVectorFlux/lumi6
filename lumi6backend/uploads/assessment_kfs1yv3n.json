  "transcript": " Yes, please introduce yourself and tell us about your hobbies. So my hobbies are watching movies, going out with friends and my wife and enjoying and having a good time. I cannot see that image, but I see in this image I see a couple walking a dog and there is a old man and he's showing some junk in the dustbin. I see in the background an old man reading newspaper that seems like a morning time. And I also see a gentleman moving the lawn and cleaning the grass. Nothing.

    "feedback": "The examinee demonstrates a fairly good usage of English language by constructing sentences correctly and describing a scene accurately. However, the examinee's vocabulary is quite limited and there is a lack of diverse sentence structures. Moreover, the speech lacks coherence due to excessive repetition of the same phrase (\"I see a couple walking a dog\") which takes away from a natural, fluent conversation. The pronunciation is generally good. Recommendations for the examinee would be to expand vocabulary, try using different sentence structures and work on maintaining a coherent and varied description."

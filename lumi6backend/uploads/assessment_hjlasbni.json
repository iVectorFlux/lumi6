    "feedback": "The test taker has shown sufficient ability to communicate in English with a reasonable understanding of grammar and vocabulary, indicating a B1 level proficiency under the CEFR scale. The fluency is moderate; despite hesitations, the repetition of phrases, and unfinished sentences, the speaker is able to generally make themselves understood. The grammar and vocabulary are also of a moderate level, although there are some noticeable mistakes and limitations. The pronunciation is quite good and is the strongest aspect of this performance, despite some minor errors that don't significantly impede comprehension. The coherence, on the other hand, is relatively weak. The speaker often repeats phrases and sentences ('Dammit, let me put this on charge,' 'You know what I mean?') without fully developing the narrative or responding appropriately to the prompt. This impacts the overall coherence and structure of speech. It's advised to work on building a broader vocabulary, enhancing grammatical accuracy, and improving the ability to construct a logically progressing narrative to increase language proficiency."

  "transcript": " Hello, my name is Kamal and I represent a company called GoFloent. I currently live in M other bar and I am a sales account executive working on solving some of the biggest problem enterprises face. Some of the hobbies I have are listening to music, watching movies, watching TV shows and focusing on learning and sometimes even reading books. I do exercise once in a while and I am also experimenting with prolonged fasting. Thank you. I really cannot see the picture here but I can maybe think of a scenario. So I see a plant that is being watered by a gardener and the gardener is wearing suit which is really not suitable for the situation. This gardener should be wearing normal clothes and I can see a house in the background. The house is kind of freely new. Seems like this place is from USA or maybe some part of first developed countries. Okay, so I cannot imagine a trip to another country but let's say if I were to places like I don't know, Switzerland. I would probably go on a long hike and a long track because I love to explore mountains and I love to push limits of my physical abilities. That is what I pretty much love and I would have to love it a little bit of snowboarding and just have a good time, eat food, drink wine, all of that stuff. Again, I am not able to look at the picture however, I can see a family gathering there. What I can see is a lot of people are joining a family gathering. It looks like a marriage to me. The lady is wearing pretty nice gown. The men are wearing suit and looking really sharp with their attire. Everyone is laughing, giggling and enjoying. People are holding wine glasses in their hands and it looks like they are having a good time. So it's definitely an occasion like a marriage or a university. Well, there have not been much of difficult situations in my life. A particular difficult situation that has been is I am trying to figure out a problem that I am currently going through which is how can I make sure that the website audio is completely optimized, can be uploaded in real time, can be shared with back end APIs and can generate, result as fast as possible. So that is a difficult situation I am currently in. To solve this, I have created a solid framework which is working pretty fine and I want to see the result now.",

    "feedback": "Kamal has a good command over the English language. He is able to speak fluently and coherently about different topics, using a wide range of vocabulary. His pronunciation is quite clear and he makes proper use of grammar in most of his sentences. However, there are a few areas where improvements could be made. Kamal made some minor errors in word choice and he can work on the precision of his language. While he was able to provide detailed descriptions of scenarios, he had some difficulty transitioning between different subjects. He either did not observe or failed to include certain transitional phrases which would have made his speech more fluid and natural. Finally, although Kamal demonstrated strong speaking skills in English, he could benefit from further refinement of his grammar in complex sentences. Otherwise, his performance was commendable."

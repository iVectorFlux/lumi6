  "transcript": " Yes, please introduce yourself and tell us about your hobbies. So my hobbies are watching movies, going out with friends and my wife and enjoying and having a good time. I cannot see that image, but I see in this image I see a couple walking a dog and there is a old man and he's showing some junk in the dustbin. I see in the background an old man reading newspaper that seems like a morning time. And I also see a gentleman moving the lawn and cleaning the grass. Nothing. I see a couple walking a dog and I see a couple walking a dog and I see a couple walking a dog. I see a couple walking a dog and I see a couple walking a dog and I see a couple walking a dog.

    "feedback": "The test taker's overall language proficiency is satisfactory, with good grammar and pronunciation. However, there's limited vocabulary range as evidenced by the repetition of phrases. The lack of variety in sentence structure and ideas greatly affected the coherence of the speech. There was little progression of ideas, particularly when describing the image. The excessive repetition of the phrase 'I see a couple walking a dog' was not tied into any other dialog smothering diversifying elements. I recommend improving fluency by expanding vocabulary and practicing more complex sentence construction while aiming for a more coherent discourse. This would enhance the progression and connection of ideas."

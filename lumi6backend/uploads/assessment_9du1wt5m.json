    "feedback": "Raya has demonstrated a reasonable level of fluency and vocabulary for everyday conversations. However, there are issues with her grammar, particularly her use of tenses, prepositions, and sentence structure, which are creating some confusion in her expressions. Although her pronunciation is generally understandable, improvement on clearer word enunciation will aid comprehension. Her coherence could be improved, as she jumps between topics without much logical progression which disrupts the overall understanding of the listener. Regular language practice with a focus on grammatical accuracy and logical sequencing of thoughts will bring particular benefits to her English language abilities."

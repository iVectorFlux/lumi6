    "feedback": "The speaker demonstrated a fairly good level of fluency and was capable of expressing a broad range of ideas. They showed an ability to talk without major disruptions, however, some sentences seemed to trail off into incoherence. Grammar usage was fair but with some errors mostly with sentence-structure, verb form, and syntax. Despite some minor issues, the speaker was generally understandable. Vocabulary was decent, with a good range of everyday words used. However, more varied and advanced vocabulary would greatly enhance the complexity and richness of expression. Pronunciation was mostly understandable but accent issues contributed to a slight reduction in clarity. The speaker's sentences often lacked cohesion resulting in a somewhat disjointed narrative. More coherence and more effective use of linking words would help in making the narration more fluid and understandable. "

    "feedback": "The speaker's fluency, vocabulary, and pronunciation are quite good overall. Maintained a fairly natural rhythm throughout the conversation. However, there was a tendency to repeat words and phrases, particularly the word 'okay', which detracts from coherence. Needs to work on formulating clearer sentences and in maintaining a consistent topic to improve coherence. There were a few grammar errors but they didn't impede understanding. Keep practicing English conversation to improve these skills."

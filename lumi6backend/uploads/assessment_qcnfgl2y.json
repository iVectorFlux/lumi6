  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Kamal and today I'm going to talk about myself, what I do and what I love. So I'm Kamal Kishore Bhatt and I come from Uttarakhand in India and I am currently working as a sales account executive and focusing on building something of my own. If I talk about my hobbies, my hobbies are watching movies, listening to music, having good time, going out to restaurant, enjoying and maybe reading books on new topics, building things that have never been. I don't know, probably Nepal. I don't know what to do and what to say. Life is good, you know. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say.",

    "feedback": "Kamal demonstrates overall good use of English language skills. He has a good command of common phrases and fluently discusses about personal interests and profession. However, there are some areas to improve. The repetition of 'I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say' decreases the coherence of the speech and does not offer any new information or points to engage with. Grammar and vocabulary are adequate but could benefit from a wider range of structures and expressions. Some sentences are overly simplistic and could be enhanced with more complex structures, synonyms or a wider range of vocabulary. Furthermore,  developing ideas with more clarity and depth can strongly enhance the overall coherence of the speech."

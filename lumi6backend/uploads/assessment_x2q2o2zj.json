    "feedback": "Kamal has a good general grasp of English, showing a clear understanding of basic sentence structure and an adequate range of vocabulary. Pronunciation is clear and easy to understand. However, there are instances of repetition and a lack of clarity in expressing complex ideas that bring down fluency and coherence. Additionally, some phrases such as 'everyone has a similar scenario experience' are grammatically incorrect and unclear in their meaning. It is recommended to work on expressing thoughts more fluidly and coherently, as well as diversifying vocabulary and reviewing complex grammatical structures."

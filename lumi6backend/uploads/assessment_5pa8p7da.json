    "feedback": "While the speech can be understood mostly, it consists of many repeated phrases and irrelevant information which hinders the coherence of the discourse. The user shows an understanding of basic grammar and a limited vocabulary. Although the pronunciation is comprehensible, the user has not demonstrated the ability to discuss a variety of topics with breadth and depth. The score reflects an intermediate level of English â€“ there are areas such as vocabulary, grammar, and coherence that need improvement. Providing more descriptive, concise, and relevant responses to the prompts would significantly raise the score."

I cannot see that image, but I see in this image I see a couple walking a dog and there is a old man and he's showing some junk in the dustbin. I see in the background an old man reading newspaper that seems like a morning time. And I also see a gentleman moving the lawn and cleaning the grass. Nothing.

    "feedback": "The speaker seems to possess a reasonable understanding of English grammar, fluency, and pronunciation. However, there is obvious room for improvement. The speaker continually repeated the same sentence numerous times, which affected the coherence and vocabulary rating poorly. He needs to diversify his vocabulary and work on varying sentence structures and content to improve coherence."

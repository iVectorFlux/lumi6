    "coherence": 2,
    "feedback": "The speaker demonstrates an ability to express basic ideas and information, but with several grammatical errors ('my husbandy age', 'thinking to going', 'want to do stay with girls') which obstructs clear understanding. The vocabulary is good for daily, basic communications but needs to be improved for more complex descriptions. Pronunciation is quite good, with no significant difficulties in understanding the spoken words. Coherence could be improved as the speaker often breaks sentence flow with 'uh, uh, uh' and changes subjects in a non-cohesive manner. Fluency is average, but the speaker seems hesitant and unsure at times. Overall, continued practice engaging in English conversations would greatly benefit the speaker, coupled with further grammatical study."

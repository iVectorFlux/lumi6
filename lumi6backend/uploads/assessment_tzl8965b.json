Verb Tense: The correct usage of past tense is crucial in describing past experiences. For example, \"I have went\" should be \"I went\" or \"I have been to\".\n\n2. Prepositions: Be sure to use the correct prepositions for each phrase. For instance, \"for have discussed with you about\" should be \"for having a discussion with you about\". \n\n3. Article usage: Both definite and indefinite articles are missing in places, or used incorrectly. For example, \"Australia is the place most beautiful\" should be \"Australia is the most beautiful place\". \n\n4. Sentence structure: Sentence structure needs to be more cohesive and to conform to English norms. For instance, \"Tomorrow, I will going to go visit UK.\" should be \"Tomorrow, I am going to visit the UK.\"\n\n5. Word usage: Try to not to use 'very much' repetitively; there are more descriptive adjectives you can use. \n\nKeep practicing! You are off to a good start. English is a complex language, and it can take time to master.",

    "feedback": "The speaker has demonstrated a strong command of the English language, showing an ability to use complex sentences and a good range of vocabulary. There is still room for improvement in coherence as the speaker repeated the phrase 'I'm building my own assessment tool called Lumisix' too many times without any needed progression or additional information which led to a drop in the overall coherence. Additionally, some of the sentences towards the end of the transcript do not follow a logical sequence or context and seem to be unrelated to each other. The pronunciation is generally clear, however, constant repetition may indicate struggling to express more complex thoughts."

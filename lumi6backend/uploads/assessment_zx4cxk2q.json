    "feedback": "The speaker shows a reasonable level of English fluency, but seems to often repeat the same grammatical structures and vocabulary, which is indicative of a somewhat limited language range. Future development efforts should focus on expanding the speaker's vocabulary breadth and richness, understanding and using more complex grammatical structures, and work on pronunciation to allow for greater comprehensibility. Using a variety of sentence structure could also improve the discourse. Furthermore, the task completion was average as the speaker could expand their ideas a little more. However, the speaker demonstrated a clear message and was able to perform a communication task in English."

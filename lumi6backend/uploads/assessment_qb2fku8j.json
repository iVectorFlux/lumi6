    "score": 77,

    "pronunciation": 4,
    "coherence": 3,
    "feedback": "The test-taker showed a relatively high level of fluency and broad vocabulary, as well as good pronunciation. However, there were instances where the incorrect use of prepositions or lack of proper sentence construction was observed, which affected the grammar score. Also, the coherence could be improved because the transition between ideas and thoughts wasn't entirely smooth in some instances. The repetition of words and phrases ('you know') is also noticeable. It is recommended that the test-taker work on these areas for improvement."

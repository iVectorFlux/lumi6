  "transcript": " Americans have the voice of America and the full rights scholarships, but the fact is, in fact, that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonald's have done more for Americans off-power around the world than any specifically government activity. So, soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments, but partly despite governments. And in the information era we all live in today, what we might call the TED age, I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incisornd diet of internet news, of televised images, of cell phone videos, of email gossip.",
  "evaluation": "Score: 85/100\n\nFeedback: \nThe test taker has a good grasp of English and has effectively communicated a complex idea. There are a few grammatical mistakes (\"Americans off-power around the world\", \"incisornd diet\") which make it hard to understand some parts of the speech and you seem to have misunderstood the term 'soft power'. Try to include better word choices and also ensure that the sentences flow smoothly into each other. Keep practicing and focus on clarifying your ideas more distinctly.",

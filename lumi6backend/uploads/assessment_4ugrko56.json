  "transcript": " Yes, please introduce yourself and tell us about your hobbies. So my hobbies are watching movies, going out with friends and my wife and enjoying and having a good time. I cannot see that image, but I see in this image I see a couple walking a dog and there is a old man and he's showing some junk in the dustbin. I see in the background an old man reading newspaper that seems like a morning time. And I also see a gentleman moving the lawn and cleaning the grass. Nothing. I see a couple walking a dog and I see a couple walking a dog and I see a couple walking a dog. I see a couple walking a dog and I see a couple walking a dog and I see a couple walking a dog.

    "feedback": "The speaker is able to communicate clearly in English and is generally fluent. However, there are some notable issues with this speech sample. They repeated 'I see a couple walking a dog' to the point of confusion which indicates a lack of diverse vocabulary and skill to describe more objects and scenarios in depth. Furthermore, this repetition also had a negative impact on the coherence of their speech, as it detracted from the overall flow and comprehension. Grammar was well-managed in general, but the speaker made a couple of minor errors (e.g. 'moving the lawn' instead of 'mowing the lawn'). There were some good efforts to use descriptive language ('there is a old man and he's showing some junk in the dustbin') which is indicative of a B1 level. Pronunciation was understandable and clear. To improve, it is advisable to work on using a wider range of vocabulary and aim for more cohesion in their spoken English."

  "transcript": " You're not ticked to this. But my suggestion here is, whatever happens happens for a good reason. And every disaster offers an opportunity to think about it. Even if you could afford it, it actually affects your parents ability to pay 90,000 dollars a year for a four year education program. You know, you are today saving one half a million dollars all expenses in today. Think what you can do with that half a million dollars. I would say there is an opportunity here to become another entrepreneur you don't need to go to Harvard to become a manager, say it's a manager production or a manager finance of a multi-national company. You know becoming a servant in a job, you become a servant, you remain a servant. Regardless of how glorified you may be, a point which I'm trying to try that is not how it's so important. I'm asking you this is the opportunity for the government to figure to introduce teachings of our environment and our community as a regular group. Harvard reporter. Will emerge as a better human being as a better manager. I would say, if I were in economics, I would say I would make chapter 18 of my would be as a regular course in the universities everywhere. What is I am? We are teaching it. I remember when I was a student in here. I heard the American Management Association president in Bombay say this very clearly that you and he and I do not need American beings with our curriculum, our courses are designed taking into account the American reality, American social, political structure, our needs. They are not your needs and he had said you must develop your own. What I the same goes is very easy to copycat. So in the Institute of Management based on the American Management techniques, I've done my meal in the international management and student in Delhi. That was based on I am a Geneva when we studied course curriculum what I am a Geneva offer now that has merged with in Seattle. Was it any different than Harvard? Because the textbooks were the same. My suggestion to every Indian is take that as an opportunity, grab it, seize the moment and I will urge government of India University grads commission and Indian Council of Social Research to start courses in one of the ether and the other. Has life lessons and business success. May the chapter 18 itself as a success for me, I think that I know this. You know the half-study. Chapter 18 raised on the success principles. Five of them. That's at the root of all management consultants in the world today.",

    "feedback": "The speaker demonstrates a good command of English vocabulary and pronunciation. They are comfortable using a variety of complex phrases and sentences, highlighting their good command of fluency. Both these elements suggest a C1 proficiency level. However, while the speaker can convey a complex message, the structure was not always clear, leading to less coherence in the speech. Grammar could also use some improvement, as there were a few errors such as 'What is I am?' which cause confusion. The speaker is recommended to work on their overall speech structure to deliver their points more clearly and coherently, and to focus on the correction of minor grammatical errors to improve their English even further."

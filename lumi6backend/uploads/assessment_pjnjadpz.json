    "feedback": "Candidate has a decent command of English and is able to communicate her thoughts, but does so with a lack of variety and depth. Most of her responses were quite repetitive (I don't see anything in that image) which demonstrates a limited vocabulary and inability to elaborate upon her thoughts. This, coupled with occasional minor grammatical mistakes, led to a lack of coherence in her speech. It would be beneficial to work on expanding vocabulary, sentence structure, and providing a more in-depth response. Pronunciation and fluency are fair but could also benefit from a bit more practice."

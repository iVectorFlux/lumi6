  "evaluation": "Score: 65/100\n\nFeedback: \nYour conversational skills such as asking and answering 'how are you?' are good. Your vocabulary usage is also decent. However, you need to work on your grammar and sentence construction which are currently disrupting the flow of your communication. For example, when you want to express your feelings, you should say \"I feel very good,\" instead of \"I am feel very very feel.\" The correct way to tell someone you are fasting is \"I am fasting. I have been fasting for 92 hours.\" This might seem a little tough but with practice, you can improve significantly. Keep practicing your English syntax and structure for better clarity and fluency.",

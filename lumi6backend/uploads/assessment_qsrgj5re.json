  "transcript": " Hello ladies and gentlemen. My name is Kamal Kishore but this is third question. This is fourth question. This is the final and fifth question.",
  "evaluation": "Score: 60/100 \n\nFeedback: Kamal, while your pronunciation and fluency appear to be good, the content of your speech is unclear. Your introduction was good but the sudden jump to numbering questions without any context or content is confusing. Remember, the goal is not just speaking in English, but also to communicate effectively. I suggest providing more context or explanations around your statements and ensure your speech has a clear structure. Don't shy away from sharing your thoughts, experiences, or knowledge while answering those questions. Additionally, when speaking or practicing spoken English, using a wider range of vocabulary can also help to lift the quality of your speech. Keep practicing!",

    "feedback": "The speaker only produced a very short sentence which doesn't allow for a thorough evaluation. Nevertheless, the pronunciation seems natural and clear. However, fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and coherence were rated low due to the lack of content beyond a basic greeting and statement. The speaker is advised to construct more complex sentences and express more diverse thoughts in order to provide a more comprehensive evaluation."

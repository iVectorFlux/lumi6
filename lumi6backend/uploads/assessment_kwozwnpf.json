  "transcript": " Hello, my name is Kabbal. I am from beautiful city of Dharaduni, North India. I currently work in fields of sales where I get the opportunity to interact with different people every day, understand their needs and help them find the right solution. I enjoy the challenge that comes with sales, especially the part where I have to be trust in relationship with clients. Outside my work, I have a variety of hobbies that keep me balanced. I really enjoy travelling, exploring new places, whether it's a illustration or quite village. I love experiencing different culture and cuisine. Cousines, I am very passionate about music and I also love a little bit of soft rock and a couple of other genres of music. I really enjoy it. I really am not able to see anything here in this image, but just to give you an idea, I can see a busy street market, there are colorful stalls selling foods, vegetables and clothes. People are walking around with vendors such as hiding a balloon and an old man is sitting near the tea stall. It looks like a bright sunny day. As in the image, I can also see people walking through the market, shopping, other just passing by once a child is holding the private balloon. The scenes like click capture are difficult in a local market where people are from different walks of life coming together, not just to buy in sell, but also to interact and connect. It reflects the energy culture and everyday life of a community. If I had a chance to plan a trip around the country, I would probably visit Japan. It's a place that beautifully blends tradition with modern technology. I would start my journey in Tokyo, exploring the vibrant city life, high-tech shops and trying authentic sushi. I would also love to visit historical sites like the temple in Kyoto and the famous temple for a sale. Aarashiyama, another must-do for me would be witnessing Mount Fuji and maybe even hiking and just enjoying the weather there. Apart from sightseeing, I would love experiencing the culture because the Japanese culture is really amazing. It's a tradition that I want to experience and really interested in Japanese manner and other cultures. Picture, I see a warm and joyful family getting possibly taking place in someone's backyard or living room. It's a long table filled with cool things like biryani, some mosa, sweets and cold drinks. People of all ages are present and are sitting and chatting, getting laid nearby and laughing while they can photos together. It looks like a festival or maybe a birthday celebration. This reminds me of a similar experience I had during Diwali with my uncle's plays in Tadun. Our entire family get together, got together after a long time, we decorated the house with lights, played cards and shared a good meal. It was an amazing experience we had. Kind of similar, we enjoyed with my cousins, did fireworks and took dozens of photos. One challenging situation I faced was during the other days of my sales career. I was assigned a major client who had a history of being very difficult and uninterested in new proposals. I remember feeling nervous but I knew I had to approach it with patient and preparation. I took time to understand the client's business need and customize the solution that actually solved the real problem for them. I also stayed consistent in my follow-ups without being pushy. Over time the client started trusting me and eventually we closed the deal. The ad experience taught me the importance of listening, persistence and adapting my approach. It was really tough for me but with my confidence I became a really good communicator and that really helped me grow in my career.",
